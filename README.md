# Building Bl.ocks
Create, fork and edit d3.js code snippets for use with bl.ocks.org right in the browser, no terminal required.

# Usage
This [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtHVdHX5uGc) is currently the most comprehensive overview of using building-blocks.  
Read about [how it works](https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/wiki/How-it-works) to get an idea of what you can do.  

Eventually we will host this with a domain, but for now let's just get it running locally by following the instructions in Development.

# Development
Instructions can be found on the [Development Wiki](https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/wiki/Development#development)
You can [read about the architecture](https://medium.com/@enjalot/architecting-a-sandbox-97b211937911) of the front-end in terms of safely rendering user code.

# Deploy your own
Instructions and related files can be found in the [deploy folder](https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/tree/master/deploy)
