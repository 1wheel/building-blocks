# Building Bl.ocks
Create, fork and edit d3.js code snippets for use with bl.ocks.org right in the browser, no terminal required.

Eventually we will host this with a domain, but for now let's just get it running locally by following the instructions in Development.

# Deploy your own
Instructions and related files can be found in the [deploy folder](https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks/tree/master/deploy)
