# Building Bl.ocks
Create, fork and edit d3.js code snippets for use with bl.ocks.org right in the browser, no terminal required.

# Usage
Eventually we will host this with a domain, but for now let's just get it running locally by following the instructions in Development.

# Development
To setup the server locally, setup dependencies then setup the server.
