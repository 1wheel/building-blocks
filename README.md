# Building Bl.ocks
Create, fork and edit d3.js code snippets for use with bl.ocks.org right in the browser, no terminal required.

# Usage
Eventually we will host this with a domain, but for now let's just get it running locally by following the instructions in Development.

# Development

```
git clone https://github.com/enjalot/building-blocks.git
cd building-blocks/
npm install
node server.js
```
Then take any bl.ock and replace the bl.ocks.org part with localhost:8889 like  
[http://localhost:8889/syntagmatic/0d4f736796ab7b465020](http://localhost:8889/syntagmatic/0d4f736796ab7b465020)
